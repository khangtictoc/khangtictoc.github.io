## Intro

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp. It enables users to define, provision, and manage cloud infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. Terraform allows developers and DevOps engineers to codify infrastructure in human-readable files that can be versioned and shared, promoting collaboration and repeatability.
